:::tip
If you want to reset your OpenRAG containers without removing OpenRAG entirely, see [Reset OpenRAG containers](/manage-services) and [Reinstall OpenRAG](/reinstall).
:::

## Uninstall TUI-managed deployments

If you used the [automated installer script](/install) or [`uvx`](/install-uvx) to install OpenRAG, clear your `uv` cache (`uv cache clean`) to remove the TUI environment, and then delete the directory containing your OpenRAG configuration files and data (where you would invoke OpenRAG).

If you used [`uv`](/install-uv) to install OpenRAG, run `uv remove openrag` in your Python project.

## Uninstall self-managed deployments

For self-managed services, destroy the containers, prune any additional Docker objects, shut down the Docling service, and delete any remaining OpenRAG files.

### Uninstall with Docker Compose or Podman Compose

1. Destroy the containers, volumes, and local images, and then remove (prune) any additional Docker objects:

   <PartialDockerComposeDownAndPrune />

2. Remove data that wasn't deleted by the previous commands:

   * OpenRAG's `.env` file
   * The contents of OpenRAG's `config` directory
   * The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory
   * The contents of the `./opensearch-data` directory
   * The `conversations.json` file

3. Stop `docling-serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py stop
   ```

### Step-by-step removal and cleanup with Docker or Podman

Use these commands for step-by-step container removal and cleanup:

1. Stop all running containers:

   <PartialDockerStopAll />

<PartialDockerRemoveAndCleanupSteps />

7. Remove data that wasn't deleted by the previous commands:

   * OpenRAG's `.env` file
   * The contents of OpenRAG's `config` directory
   * The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory
   * The contents of the `./opensearch-data` directory
   * The `conversations.json` file

8. Stop `docling-serve`:

   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/docling_ctl.py stop
   ```
