You can reset your OpenRAG deployment to its initial state by recreating the containers and deleting accessory data like the `.env` file and ingested documents.

:::warning
These are destructive operations that reset your OpenRAG deployment to an initial state.
Destroyed containers and deleted data are lost and cannot be recovered after running these operations.
:::

## Export customized flows before reinstalling

If you modified the built-in flows or created custom flows in your OpenRAG Langflow instance, and you want to preserve those changes, [export your flows](https://docs.langflow.org/concepts-flows-import) before reinstalling OpenRAG.

## Reinstall TUI-managed containers

1. In the TUI's **Status** menu (<kbd>3</kbd>), click **Factory Reset** to destroy your OpenRAG containers and some related data.

   <PartialFactorResetWarning />

2. Exit the TUI with <kbd>q</kbd>.

3. Optional: Remove data that wasn't deleted by the **Factory Reset** operation.
For a completely fresh installation, delete all of this data.

   * **OpenRAG's `.env` file**: Contains your OpenRAG configuration, including OpenRAG passwords, API keys, OAuth settings, and other [environment variables](/reference/configuration). If you delete this file, OpenRAG automatically generates a new one after you repeat the setup and onboarding process. Alternatively, you can add a prepopulated `.env` file to your OpenRAG installation directory before restarting OpenRAG.
   * **The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory**: Contains documents that you uploaded to OpenRAG. Delete these files to prevent documents from being reingested to your knowledge base after restarting OpenRAG. However, you might want to preserve OpenRAG's [default documents](https://github.com/langflow-ai/openrag/tree/main/openrag-documents).

4. Restart the TUI with `uv run openrag` or `uvx openrag`.

5. Repeat the [setup process](/install#setup) to configure OpenRAG and restart all services.
Then, launch the OpenRAG app and repeat [application onboarding](/install#application-onboarding).

   If OpenRAG detects a `.env` file during setup and onboarding, it automatically populates any OpenRAG passwords, OAuth credentials, and onboarding configuration set in that file.

## Reinstall with Docker Compose or Podman Compose

1. Destroy the containers, volumes, and local images, and then remove (prune) any additional Podman objects:

   <PartialDockerComposeDownAndPrune />

2. Optional: Remove data that wasn't deleted by the previous commands:

   * OpenRAG's `.env` file
   * The contents of OpenRAG's `config` directory
   * The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory
   * The contents of the `./opensearch-data` directory
   * The `conversations.json` file

3. If you deleted the `.env` file, prepare a new `.env` before redeploying the containers.
For more information, see [Deploy OpenRAG with self-managed services](/docker).

4. Redeploy OpenRAG:

   <PartialDockerComposeUp />

5. Launch the OpenRAG app, and then repeat [application onboarding](/docker#application-onboarding).

## Step-by-step reinstallation with Docker or Podman

Use these commands for step-by-step container removal and cleanup:

1. Stop all running containers:

   <PartialDockerStopAll />

<PartialDockerRemoveAndCleanupSteps />

7. Optional: Remove data that wasn't deleted by the previous commands:

   * OpenRAG's `.env` file
   * The contents of OpenRAG's `config` directory
   * The contents of the `./openrag-documents` directory
   * The contents of the `./opensearch-data` directory
   * The `conversations.json` file

8. [Redeploy OpenRAG](/docker).
