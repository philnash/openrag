:::tip
For a fully guided installation and preview of OpenRAG's core features, try the [quickstart](/quickstart).
:::

For guided configuration and simplified service management, install OpenRAG with services managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

The installer script installs `uv`, Docker or Podman, Docker Compose, and OpenRAG.

This installation method is best for testing OpenRAG by running it outside of a Python project.
For other installation methods, see [Select an installation method](/install-options).

## Prerequisites

<PartialPrereqCommon />

<PartialPrereqPython />

## Run the installer script {#install}

1. Create a directory to store your OpenRAG configuration files and data, and then change to that directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir openrag-workspace
   cd openrag-workspace
   ```

2. Get and run the installer script:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh | bash
   ```

   :::tip
   You can also manually [download the OpenRAG install script](https://docs.openr.ag/files/run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh), move it to your OpenRAG directory, and then run it:

   ```bash
   bash run_openrag_with_prereqs.sh
   ```
   :::

   The installer script installs OpenRAG with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) in the directory where you run the script.

3. Wait while the installer script prepares your environment and installs OpenRAG.
You might be prompted to install certain dependencies if they aren't already present in your environment.

The entire process can take a few minutes.
Once the environment is ready, the OpenRAG Terminal User Interface (TUI) starts.

Because the installer script uses `uvx`, it creates a cached, ephemeral environment in your local `uv` cache, and your OpenRAG configuration files and data are stored separately from the `uv` cache.
Clearing the cache doesn't delete your entire OpenRAG installation, only the temporary TUI environment.
After clearing the cache, run `uvx openrag` to [access the TUI](/tui) and continue with your preserved configuration and data.

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI {#setup}

When you install OpenRAG with the installer script, you manage the OpenRAG services with the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
The TUI guides you through the initial configuration process before you start the OpenRAG services.

Your [OpenRAG configuration](/reference/configuration) is stored in a `.env` file that is created automatically in the OpenRAG installation directory.
If OpenRAG detects an existing `.env` file, the TUI automatically populates those values during setup and onboarding.

Container definitions are stored in the `docker-compose` files in the OpenRAG installation directory.

Because the installer script uses `uvx`, the OpenRAG `.env` and `docker-compose` files are stored in the directory where you ran the installer script.
