For guided configuration and simplified service management, install OpenRAG with services managed by the [Terminal User Interface (TUI)](/tui).

You can use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools) to invoke OpenRAG outside of a Python project or without modifying your project's dependencies.

:::tip
The [automatic installer script](/install) also uses `uvx` to install OpenRAG.
:::

This installation method is best for testing OpenRAG by running it outside of a Python project.
For other installation methods, see [Select an installation method](/install-options).

## Install and run OpenRAG with uvx

1. Create a directory to store your OpenRAG configuration files and data, and then change to that directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir openrag-workspace
   cd openrag-workspace
   ```

2. Optional: If you want to use a pre-populated [`.env`](/reference/configuration) file for OpenRAG, copy it to this directory before invoking OpenRAG.

3. Invoke OpenRAG:

   ```bash
   uvx openrag
   ```

   You can invoke a specific version using any of the [`uvx` version specifiers](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#requesting-specific-versions), such as `--from`:

   ```bash
   uvx --from openrag==0.1.30 openrag
   ```

   Invoking OpenRAG with `uvx openrag` creates a cached, ephemeral environment for the TUI in your local `uv` cache.
   By invoking OpenRAG in a specific directory, your OpenRAG configuration files and data are stored separately from the `uv` cache.
   Clearing the `uv` cache doesn't remove your entire OpenRAG installation.
   After clearing the cache, you can re-invoke OpenRAG (`uvx openrag`) to restart the TUI with your preserved configuration and data.

If you encounter errors during installation, see [Troubleshoot OpenRAG](/support/troubleshoot).

## Set up OpenRAG with the TUI {#setup}

When you install OpenRAG with `uvx`, you manage the OpenRAG services with the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
The TUI guides you through the initial configuration process before you start the OpenRAG services.

Your [OpenRAG configuration](/reference/configuration) is stored in a `.env` file that is created automatically in the OpenRAG installation directory.
If OpenRAG detects an existing `.env` file, the TUI automatically populates those values during setup and onboarding.

Container definitions are stored in the `docker-compose` files in the OpenRAG installation directory.

With `uvx`, the OpenRAG `.env` and `docker-compose` files are stored in the directory where you invoked OpenRAG.
